Some very similar tweets are counted more than once if the user who tweeted them had a typo in the original one, deleted it, and then tweeted a seperate tweet with the same content but fixed typo. Other identical tweets are retweets or quote-tweets, which we did not take into account but is indicated in the original raw tweet data.
